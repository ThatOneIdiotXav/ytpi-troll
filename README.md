# YTP Invasion: The Troll Engine port

[(Troll Engine's README.md can be read here.)](./README-TROLL.md)

## Why?
Why not, honestly? This is just a boredom project, using YTP Invasion v3 and porting it from Codename Engine to Troll Engine, whilst trying as best as possible to make it 1-to-1.

## Is this official?
No. Despite me (xavi. / thatoneidiotxav) being one of the coders for the mod itself, this is just for fun, and for me to get used to this engine in particular.

## Why not use [insert engine here] instead?
Like I said *just above*, it's to get used with the engine. Using another engine would be pointless to the task.
